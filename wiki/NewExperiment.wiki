#NEW EXPERIMENT

1 - Create your experiment folder in your Touchstone workspace. For example, one can create a 'PointingAndDistractors' folder to conduct an experiment that measures pointing performance when there are more or less distractors in the graphical scene.
2 - Design your experiment. In the 'design' folder, run the script './launch-design.sh' (or '.\launch-design.bat' for Windows users)
3 - Complete the code for your experiment components.
4 - Run your experiment. In your experiment folder (e.g. 'PointingAndDistractors'), use the command './build.sh run' (or '.\build.bat run' for Windows users)
5 - (optional) Export your experiment as a TouchStone plug-in. In your experiment folder (e.g. 'PointingAndDistractors'), use the command './build.sh xml' (or '.\lbuild.bat xml' for Windows users). The TouchStone plug-in is the combination of a xml description file ('PointingAndDistractors/plugin.xml') and a library of experiment components ('PointingAndDistractors/build/plugin.xml' in our example).
